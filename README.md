## Introduction to Hill Climbing Algorithm

The Hill Climbing Algorithm is a local search algorithm used for optimization problems. It iteratively improves a candidate solution by making incremental changes to it. This repository provides a comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's principles and its applications.

## Pseudocode

Detailed pseudocode for the Hill Climbing Algorithm is provided to aid in understanding its implementation and logic.

## Illustrative Examples

Illustrative examples demonstrate how the Hill Climbing Algorithm works in practice, helping users grasp its behavior and characteristics.

## Python Code

Python implementation of the Hill Climbing Algorithm is provided in this repository. Users can directly access the code and utilize it for their projects or further experimentation.

## Application: Solving the 8 Queens Problem

The 8 Queens Problem is a classic puzzle that challenges participants to place eight queens on an 8×8 chessboard in a way that no two queens threaten each other. This repository includes a specific application of the Hill Climbing Algorithm to solve this problem efficiently.
